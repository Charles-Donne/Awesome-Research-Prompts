## 0. Metadata & Positioning

- Publication date, author/team, organization
- Core theme and target audience
- Length/read time and document type (announcement, deep dive, case study)

## 1. High-level Summary (2–3 sentences)

- Problem/background and prior state
- What is proposed/what’s new
- Key takeaway and impact

## 2. Key Technical Contributions

- 3–5 concrete contributions; bold key terms and parameters
- Include algorithm/model/dataset/training details if provided
- System/infra changes affecting performance or reliability

## 3. Architecture / Methods

- End-to-end flow (input → processing → state/model → output)
- Core components and their roles
- Critical formulas/objectives (LaTeX if any) or succinct in-text diagram

## 4. Experiments & Performance

- Datasets, settings, metrics; cite exact numbers with units
- Baselines/ablations and relative deltas
- Efficiency: latency/throughput/cost/memory; hardware/runtime context

## 5. Applications & Value

- Scenarios/use cases, new features, case studies
- Business/industry impact and constraints

## 6. Innovations & Differentiators

- What’s novel vs prior work and comparable systems
- Advantages and trade-offs

## 7. Limitations / Risks / Open Problems

- Data/compute/assumptions; failure modes
- Generalization, safety, privacy, compliance

## 8. Practical Guidance (to apply it)

- Preconditions (data, compute), integration notes
- Repro tips (seeds, versions), pitfalls to avoid
- Next steps or questions to validate

Output & Formatting:

- Reply in Chinese; use bold for key data/terms; cite numbers precisely
- Math: LaTeX inline ($...$) or block ($$...$$)
- One blank line between sections; no trailing commentary
